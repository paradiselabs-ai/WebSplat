- Optimize performance where possible

## Day 4: Demo Preparation
- Create a compelling demo script

- Practice the demo presentation
- Ensure smooth running of live demonstration

## Day 5: Final Touches and Submission
- Address any last-minute issues

- Prepare talking points about future scalability and potential

Remember(for myself as I tend to jump ahead):  Focus on demonstrating the core concept and unique value proposition of WebSplat. It's better to have a working demo of the central idea than to attempt implementing all features.
