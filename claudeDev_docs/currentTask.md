# Current Task

Implement New Design and Update Backend

## Objectives
- Integrate the new frontend design with the existing backend
- Update backend routes to support new frontend functionality
- Ensure all components work together seamlessly

## Steps
1. [x] Rename HTML, CSS, and JS files:
   - newDesign.html to index.html
   - newDesign.css to styles.css
   - newDesign.js to script.js
2. [x] Update app.py:
   - Add new route for getting agent statuses
   - Ensure all routes return a success flag
   - Update existing routes to work with the new frontend
3. [x] Update ai_agents.py:
   - Add get_status() method to AIAgent class
   - Make necessary adjustments to support new functionality
4. [x] Update credential handling in app.py and ai_agents.py:
   - Parse Google credentials JSON directly from environment variable
   - Add error handling for JSON parsing and credential validation
5. [ ] Test the application:
   - Ensure it runs without errors related to credentials
   - Test all functionalities of the new interface
6. [ ] Implement error handling on the frontend:
   - Update JavaScript to handle responses with success flags
7. [ ] Optimize performance:
   - Ensure the interface is responsive and efficient, especially with large amounts of data

## Notes
- Keep in mind the "5 laws" of WebSplat when making changes
- Ensure all changes align with the project's goals of showcasing AI capabilities and generating passive income
- Consider user experience and interface responsiveness throughout the implementation

## Completed Tasks
- Created new design files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Renamed design files to standard names (index.html, styles.css, script.js)
- Updated index.html to reference correct CSS and JS files
- Updated app.py with new routes and success flags
- Updated ai_agents.py with get_status() method and necessary adjustments
- Updated credential handling in app.py and ai_agents.py

## Next Steps
- Test the application thoroughly
- Implement error handling on the frontend
- Optimize performance
- After implementing and testing the new design, revisit and update unit tests
- Run the pytest command to execute all tests
- Analyze test results and identify failing tests
- Debug and fix any failing tests
- Add additional tests to improve coverage if needed

## Future Considerations
- Implement collaborative features for AI agents to work on tasks simultaneously
- Enhance the dashboard with more advanced analytics and visualizations
- Implement A/B testing capabilities for comparing different AI strategies
- Develop a plugin system for easy integration of new AI models or services
- Research and implement advanced caching system
- Design and implement version control system for project states
