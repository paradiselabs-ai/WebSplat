# Current Task

Implement New User Interface and Agent Workflow with Live TSX Preview (MVP for Hackathon)

## Objectives
- Quickly integrate the backend with the frontend for a working demo
- Implement additional views (monetization, SEO, etc.) in the interface left pane
- Provide user-friendly visualizations of agent progress and ideas
- Maintain all existing functionality and workflows
- Ensure the consulting agent can provide progress updates and explain strategies

## Urgent Steps (Less than 12 hours)
1. [x] Rapidly integrate backend with frontend
2. [x] Implement additional views in the left pane
3. [x] Enhance the consultation agent's capabilities
4. [x] Quick UI/UX improvements
5. [x] Update the frontend to use new backend capabilities
6. [x] Create test files for backend, frontend, and integration testing
7. [ ] Conduct rapid testing:
   - Run backend tests
   - Run frontend tests
   - Run integration tests
   - Verify all components are working together
   - Test user interactions and agent responses
   - Ensure real-time updates are displayed correctly in all views

## Remaining Urgent Tasks
1. Run all tests and fix any issues:
   a. [ ] Run backend tests (python tests/test_backend.py)
   b. [ ] Run frontend tests (python tests/test_frontend.py)
   c. [ ] Run integration tests (python tests/test_integration.py)
   d. [ ] Address any failures or errors in the tests
2. [ ] Perform manual testing to ensure smooth user experience
3. [ ] Update documentation based on final implementation

## Notes
- DO NOT REMOVE OR ALTER ANY EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY OR CODE
- Focus on integrating what we have as a working demo
- Prioritize speed and functionality over perfection for this MVP
- Ensure users can easily understand the direction agents are moving in each aspect
- Allow users to provide feedback or change approach through the consulting agent

## Next Steps (Post-MVP, if time allows)
- Refine UI/UX based on initial testing
- Expand functionality of additional views
- Implement more comprehensive progress visualization
- Conduct more thorough testing and bug fixes

Remember: The goal is a working demo that showcases the core functionality and potential of the system. Prioritize integration and basic functionality of new views while preserving all existing work.

## Final Checklist Before Demo
1. [ ] Verify all backend endpoints are functioning correctly
2. [ ] Ensure frontend is successfully communicating with the backend
3. [ ] Test all user interactions (chat, requesting progress reports, strategy explanations)
4. [ ] Verify real-time updates in all views
5. [ ] Check responsiveness and layout on different screen sizes
6. [ ] Prepare a brief demonstration script highlighting key features
7. [ ] Test the demo flow to ensure smooth presentation

## Test Execution Steps
1. Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running
2. Run backend tests: `python tests/test_backend.py`
3. Run frontend tests: `python tests/test_frontend.py`
4. Run integration tests: `python tests/test_integration.py`
5. Review test results and fix any issues
6. Perform manual testing to catch any edge cases or user experience issues
