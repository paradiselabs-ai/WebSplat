# Current Task

Implement New User Interface and Agent Workflow with Live TSX Preview (MVP for Hackathon)

## Objectives
- Verify and ensure frontend functionality is working properly across all components
- Quickly integrate the backend with the frontend for a working demo
- Implement additional views (monetization, SEO, etc.) in the interface left pane
- Provide user-friendly visualizations of agent progress and ideas
- Maintain all existing functionality and workflows
- Ensure the consulting agent can provide progress updates and explain strategies
- Implement and test TSX preview feature
- Function more like Vercel's v0, with the consultation agent guiding the user through the process and providing real-time updates
- Show a live render of the TSX code in the preview window rather than the code itself
- Implement backend agents collaboration to generate the actual website code
- Set up a system for serving the generated websites
- Prepare for hosting and deployment on Google Cloud

## Completed Steps
1. [x] Rapidly integrate backend with frontend
2. [x] Implement additional views in the left pane

6. [x] Create test files for backend, frontend, and integration testing
7. [x] Create and refine Mermaid charts illustrating the MVP workflow for frontend and backend
8. [x] Update backend (main.py) to generate TSX preview based on AI responses
9. [x] Modify WebSplatInterface.tsx to include a new "Preview" tab for displaying generated TSX code
10. [x] Update handleSendMessage function to set generatedHtml state with tsx_preview from backend response
11. [x] Update the backend to include a workspace for code generation and iteration
12. [x] Implement basic real-time rendering system for the preview window
13. [x] Update test files with additional logging and assertions
14. [x] Split WebSplatInterface.tsx into modular components
15. [x] Create comprehensive test files for all components
16. [x] Update frontend test plan to reflect new component structure
17. [x] Verify backend functionality with comprehensive testing
18. [x] Map out integration points between frontend and backend
19. [x] Fix WebSocket cleanup and reconnection logic
20. [x] Add auto-scroll functionality to chat messages
21. [x] Remove unused generatedHtml prop from components
22. [x] Update tests to reflect recent changes
