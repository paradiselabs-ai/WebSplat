# Current Task

Run and fix unit tests for the AI agent system and Flask routes

## Objectives
- Run the existing test suite
- Identify and fix any failing tests
- Improve test coverage where necessary

## Steps
1. [ ] Run the pytest command to execute all tests
2. [ ] Analyze test results and identify failing tests
3. [ ] Debug and fix any failing tests
4. [ ] Add additional tests to improve coverage if needed
5. [ ] Re-run the test suite to confirm all tests are passing

## Notes
- Use the command: `pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing` to run tests with coverage report
- Pay attention to any warnings or deprecation notices
- Consider using mock objects for API calls to avoid unnecessary API usage during tests

## Completed Tasks
- Created test files for AI agents and Flask routes
- Updated requirements.txt with testing dependencies
- Installed new dependencies successfully
- Removed previous git versioning
- Created a new GitHub repository for the project
- Added .gitignore to exclude claudeDev_docs directory
- Pushed the initial project setup to the GitHub repository

## Next Steps
- After fixing and improving tests, proceed with implementing the advanced caching system
- Research database options for caching (e.g., Redis, MongoDB)
- Design the version control system for project states

## Future Considerations
- Implement collaborative features for AI agents to work on tasks simultaneously
- Enhance the dashboard with more advanced analytics and visualizations
- Implement A/B testing capabilities for comparing different AI strategies
- Develop a plugin system for easy integration of new AI models or services
