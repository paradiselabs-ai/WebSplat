# Current Task

Implement New User Interface and Agent Workflow with Live TSX Preview

## Objectives
- Create a sleek, intuitive, and modern user interface using React and Next.js
- Implement a main chat interface for user-AI interaction
- Develop a hierarchical agent workflow with O1 and Vertex AI as the main reasoning/brain
- Integrate web search capabilities using Tavily or Perplexity
- Implement an adjustable autonomy and creativity meter for agents
- Create tabs for different aspects of website development (UI design, monetization, SEO)
- Implement a toggle-able window view for UI design progress with live TSX rendering

## Steps
1. [x] Update the frontend to React/Next.js:
   - Set up a new React/Next.js project
   - Create a main chat interface component
   - Implement tabs for different aspects of website development
   - Create an adjustable autonomy/creativity meter component
   - Implement a toggle-able window view for UI design progress
2. [x] Implement live TSX rendering for real-time preview
3. [ ] Update backend to support new frontend functionality:
   - Implement routes for the main chat interface
   - Create endpoints for different agent functionalities
   - Implement web search integration (Tavily or Perplexity)
4. [ ] Refactor AI agent system:
   - Implement hierarchical agent workflow with O1 and Vertex AI at the top
   - Create modular, task-switchable lower-level agents
   - Implement inter-agent communication and task delegation
5. [ ] Integrate web search functionality:
   - Implement Tavily or Perplexity API integration for web searches
   - Create a system for agents to use search results in their decision-making
6. [ ] Implement autonomy and creativity control:
   - Create a system to adjust agent behavior based on the autonomy/creativity meter
   - Implement logic for more or less user prompting based on the meter setting
7. [ ] Create collaborative agent workflow:
   - Implement a system for agents to delegate tasks to each other
   - Create a communication system between agents
8. [ ] Integrate O1 model as the main reasoning/brain:
   - Implement O1 model integration for high-level decision making
   - Create a system for O1 to delegate tasks to other agents and models
9. [ ] Implement progress visualization:
   - Create components to display progress of UI design, monetization strategies, and SEO optimization
   - Implement real-time updates of progress in the frontend
10. [ ] Test the entire system:
    - Conduct thorough testing of all components and their interactions
    - Ensure smooth communication between frontend, backend, and AI agents
11. [ ] Optimize performance and user experience:
    - Refine UI/UX based on testing results
    - Optimize backend for efficient handling of multiple AI agent interactions

## Notes
- Ensure all changes align with the project's goals of showcasing AI capabilities and generating passive income
- Consider user experience and interface responsiveness throughout the implementation
- Regularly update documentation to reflect new features and workflows

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation of the backend routes to support the new frontend functionality
- Start refactoring the AI agent system to support the new hierarchical workflow
- Investigate and implement web search API integration
