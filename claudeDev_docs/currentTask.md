# Current Task

Implement New User Interface and Agent Workflow with Live TSX Preview (MVP for Hackathon)

## Objectives
- Quickly integrate the backend with the frontend for a working demo
- Implement additional views (monetization, SEO, etc.) in the interface left pane
- Provide user-friendly visualizations of agent progress and ideas
- Maintain all existing functionality and workflows
- Ensure the consulting agent can provide progress updates and explain strategies

## Urgent Steps (Less than 12 hours)
1. [x] Rapidly integrate backend with frontend:
   - Ensure all existing agent communications are preserved
   - Verify that the consulting agent can properly interact with the user and other agents
2. [x] Implement additional views in the left pane:
   a. [x] Monetization view:
      - Display a list of monetization ideas
      - Show real-time updates as ideas are refined
   b. [x] SEO view:
      - Display key SEO strategies and recommendations
   c. [x] Other relevant views (UI Design, Analytics, etc.):
      - Implement basic visualizations for each aspect
3. [x] Enhance the consultation agent's capabilities:
   - Enable progress report generation on user request
   - Implement functionality to explain specific strategies (e.g., monetization)
4. [x] Quick UI/UX improvements:
   - Ensure all toggle buttons for different views are functional
   - Implement a simple progress visualization for overall project status
5. [x] Update the frontend to use new backend capabilities:
   - Implement functionality to request and display progress reports
   - Add ability to request and show strategy explanations for different aspects (monetization, SEO, etc.)
6. [ ] Conduct rapid testing:
   - Verify all components are working together
   - Test user interactions and agent responses
   - Ensure real-time updates are displayed correctly in all views

## Remaining Urgent Tasks
1. Conduct rapid testing:
   - Set up a testing environment and create test cases
   - Verify that all components are working together as expected
   - Test user interactions and agent responses thoroughly
   - Ensure real-time updates are displayed correctly in all views

## Notes
- DO NOT REMOVE OR ALTER ANY EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY OR CODE
- Focus on integrating what we have as a working demo
- Prioritize speed and functionality over perfection for this MVP
- Ensure users can easily understand the direction agents are moving in each aspect
- Allow users to provide feedback or change approach through the consulting agent

## Next Steps (Post-MVP, if time allows)
- Refine UI/UX based on initial testing
- Expand functionality of additional views
- Implement more comprehensive progress visualization
- Conduct more thorough testing and bug fixes

Remember: The goal is a working demo that showcases the core functionality and potential of the system. Prioritize integration and basic functionality of new views while preserving all existing work.

## Final Checklist Before Demo
1. [ ] Verify all backend endpoints are functioning correctly
2. [ ] Ensure frontend is successfully communicating with the backend
3. [ ] Test all user interactions (chat, requesting progress reports, strategy explanations)
4. [ ] Verify real-time updates in all views
5. [ ] Check responsiveness and layout on different screen sizes
6. [ ] Prepare a brief demonstration script highlighting key features
7. [ ] Test the demo flow to ensure smooth presentation
