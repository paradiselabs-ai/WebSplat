# Current Task

Implement unit tests and advanced caching for the hybrid AI agent system

## Objectives
- Develop comprehensive unit tests for the AI agent system and Flask routes
- Implement a more advanced caching system using a database for persistence
- Enhance project state management with version control and rollback capabilities

## Steps
1. [x] Create a test directory and set up a testing framework (pytest)
2. [x] Write unit tests for key functions in ai_agents.py
3. [x] Develop integration tests for Flask routes in app.py
4. [x] Update requirements.txt with pytest and pytest-cov
5. [x] Install new testing dependencies
6. [ ] Run the test suite and fix any failing tests
7. [ ] Research and choose an appropriate database for caching (e.g., Redis, MongoDB)
8. [ ] Implement database integration for caching AI responses and performance metrics
9. [ ] Design and implement a version control system for project states
10. [ ] Create rollback functionality for reverting to previous project states

## Notes
- To run tests, use the command: `pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing`
- Ensure test coverage for both success and error scenarios
- Consider using mock objects for API calls in tests to avoid unnecessary API usage
- Implement proper error handling and logging in the caching system
- Design the version control system to be scalable and efficient

## Completed Tasks
- Created test files for AI agents and Flask routes
- Updated requirements.txt with testing dependencies
- Installed new dependencies successfully

## Next Steps
- Run the test suite and address any failing tests
- Begin research on database options for advanced caching
- Start designing the version control system for project states

## Future Considerations
- Improve web development capabilities by integrating code generation features
- Implement collaborative features for AI agents to work on tasks simultaneously
- Enhance the dashboard with more advanced analytics and visualizations
- Implement A/B testing capabilities for comparing different AI strategies
- Develop a plugin system for easy integration of new AI models or services
