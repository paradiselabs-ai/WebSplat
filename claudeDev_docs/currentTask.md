# Current Task

Implement New User Interface and Agent Workflow with Live TSX Preview (MVP for Hackathon)

## Objectives
- Quickly integrate the backend with the frontend for a working demo
- Implement additional views (monetization, SEO, etc.) in the interface left pane
- Provide user-friendly visualizations of agent progress and ideas
- Maintain all existing functionality and workflows
- Ensure the consulting agent can provide progress updates and explain strategies
- Implement and test TSX preview feature
- Function more like Vercel's v0, with the consultation agent guiding the user through the process and providing real-time updates
- Show a live render of the TSX code in the preview window rather than the code itself
- Implement backend agents collaboration to generate the actual website code
- Set up a system for serving the generated websites
- Prepare for hosting and deployment on Google Cloud

## Completed Steps
1. [x] Rapidly integrate backend with frontend
2. [x] Implement additional views in the left pane
3. [x] Enhance the consultation agent's capabilities
4. [x] Quick UI/UX improvements
5. [x] Update the frontend to use new backend capabilities
6. [x] Create test files for backend, frontend, and integration testing
7. [x] Create and refine Mermaid charts illustrating the MVP workflow for frontend and backend
8. [x] Update backend (main.py) to generate TSX preview based on AI responses
9. [x] Modify WebSplatInterface.tsx to include a new "Preview" tab for displaying generated TSX code
10. [x] Update handleSendMessage function to set generatedHtml state with tsx_preview from backend response
11. [x] Update the backend to include a workspace for code generation and iteration
12. [x] Implement basic real-time rendering system for the preview window
13. [x] Update test files with additional logging and assertions

## Urgent Steps (Less than 12 hours)
1. [ ] Fix issues identified in backend tests:
   a. [ ] Resolve missing workspace_id in consult endpoint response
   b. [ ] Fix 404 errors in preview and serve endpoints
   c. [ ] Address WebSocket connection 403 Forbidden error
   d. [ ] Ensure shared knowledge is properly updated with testimonials
2. [ ] Implement the Autogen multi-agent system for collaborative website creation
3. [ ] Integrate GroundX RAG system for shared knowledge and information retrieval
4. [ ] Set up a system for serving the generated websites on a local development server
5. [ ] Improve the AI agents' collaboration and code generation process
6. [ ] Implement WebSocket communication for real-time updates between frontend and backend
7. [ ] Enhance the preview functionality to show a live render of the generated website
8. [ ] Implement the consultation agent as a conduit between the user and the Autogen agents
9. [ ] Set up the R&D agent to research and add information to the GroundX RAG system
10. [ ] Implement monetization and SEO strategy generation and integration
11. [ ] Conduct rapid testing:
   - Run backend tests
   - Run frontend tests
   - Run integration tests
   - Verify all components are working together
   - Test user interactions and agent responses
   - Ensure real-time updates are displayed correctly in all views
   - Test new TSX preview feature and live rendering

## Remaining Urgent Tasks
1. Run all tests and fix any issues:
   a. [x] Run backend tests (python tests/test_backend.py)
   b. [ ] Run frontend tests (python tests/test_frontend.py)
   c. [ ] Run integration tests (python tests/test_integration.py)
   d. [ ] Address any failures or errors in the tests
2. [ ] Perform manual testing to ensure smooth user experience
3. [ ] Update documentation based on final implementation
4. [ ] Create and execute a test plan for the TSX preview feature and live rendering

## Notes
- DO NOT REMOVE OR ALTER ANY EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY OR CODE
- Focus on integrating what we have as a working demo
- Prioritize speed and functionality over perfection for this MVP
- Ensure users can easily understand the direction agents are moving in each aspect
- Allow users to provide feedback or change approach through the consulting agent
- The actual code generation and iteration should occur on the backend, in a designated workspace within the project structure
- The generated website should be served from the backend, allowing the user to view and interact with it in real-time through the preview window
- Use the GroundX RAG system for maintaining shared knowledge and information retrieval
- Implement the consultation agent as a conduit between the user and the Autogen multi-agent system
- Ensure the backend can start a local development server to host the generated website for user preview

## Next Steps (Post-MVP, if time allows)
- Refine UI/UX based on initial testing
- Expand functionality of additional views
- Implement more comprehensive progress visualization
- Conduct more thorough testing and bug fixes
- Enhance TSX preview display (syntax highlighting, copy to clipboard)
- Improve error handling
- Optimize performance
- Enhance AI agent system
- Add user authentication
- Implement collaborative features
- Prepare for deployment on Google Cloud

Remember: The goal is a working demo that showcases the core functionality and potential of the system. Prioritize integration and basic functionality of new views while preserving all existing work.

## Final Checklist Before Demo
1. [ ] Verify all backend endpoints are functioning correctly
2. [ ] Ensure frontend is successfully communicating with the backend
3. [ ] Test all user interactions (chat, requesting progress reports, strategy explanations)
4. [ ] Verify real-time updates in all views
5. [ ] Check responsiveness and layout on different screen sizes
6. [ ] Prepare a brief demonstration script highlighting key features
7. [ ] Test the demo flow to ensure smooth presentation
8. [ ] Review the MVP workflow charts with the team
9. [ ] Test TSX preview feature thoroughly
10. [ ] Verify the live rendering of the generated website in the preview window

## Test Execution Steps
1. Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running
2. Run backend tests: `python tests/test_backend.py`
3. Run frontend tests: `python tests/test_frontend.py`
4. Run integration tests: `python tests/test_integration.py`
5. Review test results and fix any issues
6. Perform manual testing to catch any edge cases or user experience issues
7. Update documentation if any changes were made during testing
8. Execute TSX preview feature test plan
9. Test the real-time collaboration of backend agents in generating website code
10. Verify the serving and interaction with the generated website through the preview window
