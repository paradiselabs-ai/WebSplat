# Google Cloud Storage Plan for WebSplat

## Storage Options

### 1. Cloud Firestore
- NoSQL database perfect for workspace data
- Real-time updates (great for workspace state)
- Easy to use with Python
- Good free tier
- Built-in offline persistence

Ideal for storing:
- Workspace metadata
- User session data
- Shared knowledge state
- Agent progress tracking
- Real-time collaboration data

### 2. Cloud Storage
- For storing workspace files
- Works well with Firestore
- Perfect for TSX/HTML files
- Good for large files

Ideal for storing:
- Generated TSX files
- HTML previews
- Assets and resources
- Cached responses
- Generated website files

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Local Implementation
1. Update workspace_manager.py with metadata structure
   - Add creation time, last access time
   - Add workspace status tracking
   - Add state persistence layer
   - Keep using file system temporarily

2. Add Google Cloud integration points
   - Create cloud storage abstraction layer
   - Add Firestore data models
   - Keep cloud features inactive
   - Maintain local fallback

3. Test local functionality
   - Ensure all existing tests pass
   - Add new tests for metadata
   - Verify state persistence
   - Test cleanup mechanisms

### Phase 2: Cloud Migration
1. Set up Google Cloud Project
   - Configure project settings
   - Set up authentication
   - Configure security rules
   - Set up monitoring

2. Implement Firestore Integration
   - Create Firestore collections
   - Set up data models
   - Implement CRUD operations
   - Add real-time listeners

3. Implement Cloud Storage
   - Create storage buckets
   - Set up file organization
   - Implement file operations
   - Add caching layer

### Phase 3: Testing and Deployment
1. Test Cloud Features
   - Verify data persistence
   - Test real-time updates
   - Validate file operations
   - Check performance

2. Implement Fallback Mechanisms
   - Add offline support
   - Implement retry logic
   - Add error recovery
   - Test failure scenarios

3. Deploy and Monitor
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure monitoring
   - Set up alerts
   - Track usage metrics

## Benefits of This Approach
1. Keep existing functionality working
2. Don't break any tests
3. Have a clear path to cloud migration
4. Can test everything locally first
5. Maintain backward compatibility
6. Enable gradual feature rollout
7. Ensure data consistency
8. Support future scaling

## Next Steps
1. Update workspace_manager.py with new metadata structure
2. Add cloud integration points while keeping them inactive
3. Test all functionality locally
4. Begin Google Cloud setup process
5. Migrate data to cloud storage
6. Enable cloud features incrementally

## Notes
- Keep all existing tests passing throughout the process
- Maintain backward compatibility at each step
- Document all cloud configuration steps
- Create recovery procedures
- Monitor performance impacts
- Track costs and usage
- Plan for scaling
