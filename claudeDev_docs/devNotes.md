# Development Notes

## Recent Changes
- Implemented new frontend design with improved user interface
- Renamed frontend files for consistency:
  - newDesign.html to index.html
  - newDesign.css to styles.css
  - newDesign.js to script.js
- Updated index.html to reference correct CSS and JS files
- Updated app.py to include new routes and ensure all routes return a success flag
- Modified ai_agents.py to include get_status() method for AIAgent class
- Added current_task and last_action_timestamp attributes to AIAgent class
- Updated make_decision() and execute_task() methods in AIAgent class to set current_task and last_action_timestamp
- Updated credential handling in both app.py and ai_agents.py:
  - Now parsing Google credentials JSON directly from GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable
  - Added error handling for JSON parsing and credential validation
  - Ensured consistent credential handling across both files
- Reformatted .env file:
  - Updated GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to be a single-line JSON string

## Current Focus
- Testing the application to ensure it runs without errors related to credentials
- Testing the new interface to ensure all functionality works as expected with the new file structure and updated routes
- Implementing error handling on the frontend
- Optimizing performance for responsiveness and efficiency

## Git and Version Control
- Repository: https://github.com/paradiselabs-ai/WebSplat
- Main branch: main
- .gitignore: Excludes claudeDev_docs/ directory and sensitive files (.env, google_credentials.json)
- Recent commits:
  - "Update frontend design"
  - "Rename frontend files for consistency"
  - "Update backend to support new frontend"
  - "Implement get_status() method in AIAgent class"
  - "Update credential handling in app.py and ai_agents.py"
  - "Reformat .env file for proper credential handling"

## Best Practices
- Follow React best practices for component structure and state management
- Use Flask blueprints for organizing backend routes
- Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application
- Adhere to PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript/React code formatting
- Implement comprehensive logging for AI model usage and performance
- Use type hints in Python code for better maintainability
- Regularly update documentation to reflect current project state and future plans
- Use pytest for running tests and measuring code coverage
- Commit changes regularly and use meaningful commit messages
- Keep sensitive information (like API keys) out of version control

## Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for individual components of the AI agent system
- Implement integration tests for Flask routes
- Use mock objects to simulate AI model responses in tests
- Aim for high code coverage, especially in critical parts of the application
- Run tests regularly, especially before committing changes
- Command to run tests: pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing

## Common Issues and Solutions
1. Issue: AI model API rate limiting
   Solution: Implement exponential backoff and retry mechanism for API calls

2. Issue: Inconsistent AI-generated content
   Solution: Implement content validation checks and use multiple AI models for verification

3. Issue: High latency in AI model responses
   Solution: Implement caching for frequently requested information and use asynchronous processing where possible

4. Issue: Difficulty in tracking AI agent performance
   Solution: Implemented a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing AI usage and performance metrics

5. Issue: Secure handling of credentials
   Solution: Use environment variables for sensitive information and parse JSON directly in the application

6. Issue: Multiline JSON in .env file
   Solution: Reformat the JSON as a single line in the .env file for proper parsing

## Hybrid AI Agent Implementation Notes
- Use the estimate_complexity method to determine which AI model (o1 or Vertex AI) to use for a given task
- Implement a fallback mechanism to switch between models if one fails or produces unsatisfactory results
- Use the @lru_cache decorator for caching frequently called methods to reduce API calls
- Regularly update the AIMLClient class to incorporate new features from the o1 model as they become available
- Monitor and analyze the performance metrics of different AI models to optimize their usage

## Dashboard and Metrics
- Implemented a real-time dashboard for visualizing AI agent performance
- Added charts for model usage distribution and average execution time
- Included aggregated metrics for total calls, model-specific calls, and error counts
- Ensure regular updates of the dashboard to reflect the most recent AI agent activities

## Next Steps
- Thoroughly test the application to ensure it runs without errors related to credentials
- Test all functionalities of the new interface
- Implement error handling on the frontend, particularly for API responses
- Optimize performance, focusing on responsiveness and efficiency with large amounts of data
- Update unit tests to reflect recent changes in the backend
- Consider implementing more advanced features such as real-time updates and detailed agent interactions

Remember to update this document regularly with new insights, solutions to challenges, and important development practices specific to WebSplat. As the project evolves, continually reassess and optimize the integration of various AI models and services.
