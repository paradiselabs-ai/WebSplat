- Created integration tests for Flask routes (test_app.py)
- Added pytest and pytest-cov to requirements.txt for testing and code coverage
- Set up pytest.ini for test configuration
- Successfully installed new testing dependencies
- Removed previous git versioning
- Created a new GitHub repository for the project
- Added .gitignore to exclude claudeDev_docs directory
- Pushed the initial project setup to the GitHub repository

## Current Focus
- Running and fixing unit tests for the AI agent system and Flask routes
- Implementing advanced caching system using a database
- Enhancing project state management with version control and rollback capabilities

## Git and Version Control
- Repository: https://github.com/paradiselabs-ai/WebSplat
- Main branch: main
- .gitignore: Excludes claudeDev_docs/ directory
- Initial commit: "Initial commit: WebSplat project setup (excluding claudeDev_docs)"

## Best Practices
- Follow React best practices for component structure and state management
- Use Flask blueprints for organizing backend routes
- Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application
- Adhere to PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript/React code formatting
- Implement comprehensive logging for AI model usage and performance
- Use type hints in Python code for better maintainability
- Regularly update documentation to reflect current project state and future plans
- Use pytest for running tests and measuring code coverage
- Commit changes regularly and use meaningful commit messages
- Keep sensitive information (like API keys) out of version control

## Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for individual components of the AI agent system
- Implement integration tests for Flask routes
- Use mock objects to simulate AI model responses in tests
- Aim for high code coverage, especially in critical parts of the application
- Run tests regularly, especially before committing changes
- Command to run tests: pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing

## Common Issues and Solutions
1. Issue: AI model API rate limiting
   Solution: Implement exponential backoff and retry mechanism for API calls

2. Issue: Inconsistent AI-generated content
   Solution: Implement content validation checks and use multiple AI models for verification

3. Issue: High latency in AI model responses
   Solution: Implement caching for frequently requested information and use asynchronous processing where possible

4. Issue: Difficulty in tracking AI agent performance
   Solution: Implemented a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing AI usage and performance metrics

## Hybrid AI Agent Implementation Notes
- Use the estimate_complexity method to determine which AI model (o1 or Vertex AI) to use for a given task
- Implement a fallback mechanism to switch between models if one fails or produces unsatisfactory results
- Use the @lru_cache decorator for caching frequently called methods to reduce API calls
- Regularly update the AIMLClient class to incorporate new features from the o1 model as they become available
- Monitor and analyze the performance metrics of different AI models to optimize their usage

## Dashboard and Metrics
- Implemented a real-time dashboard for visualizing AI agent performance
- Added charts for model usage distribution and average execution time
- Included aggregated metrics for total calls, model-specific calls, and error counts
- Ensure regular updates of the dashboard to reflect the most recent AI agent activities

## SEO Optimization Techniques
- Implement automated keyword research using AI agents
- Use AI-generated meta tags and descriptions
- Implement schema markup for better search engine understanding
- Integrate AI-driven content optimization for target keywords

## Passive Income Strategies
- Implement AI-driven ad placement optimization
- Use AI to generate and optimize affiliate marketing content
- Implement dynamic pricing strategies for digital products
- Develop AI-curated subscription content services

## Analytics Integration
- Use Google Analytics for basic website traffic analysis
- Implement custom event tracking for AI agent actions
- Develop a dashboard for visualizing AI model performance metrics
- Integrate A/B testing capabilities for AI-generated content and designs

## Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical content
- Use server-side rendering for initial page load
- Optimize database queries and implement indexing
- Use a CDN for static asset delivery
- Monitor and optimize AI model execution times

## Security Considerations
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization for framework users
- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
- Implement input validation and sanitization, especially for AI-generated content
- Ensure secure handling and storage of AI model API keys and credentials

## Deployment Notes
- Use Docker for containerization to ensure consistent environments
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Use environment variables for sensitive information and API keys
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates

## AI Model Management
- Regularly monitor and analyze AI model performance metrics
- Implement a system for easy switching between different AI models or versions
- Develop a protocol for testing and integrating new AI models as they become available
- Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the hybrid AI approach (o1 and Vertex AI)

## Error Handling and Logging
- Implement centralized error logging and monitoring
- Use structured logging for easier parsing and analysis
- Implement custom error classes for different types of AI-related errors
- Set up alerts for critical errors or unusual AI behavior
- Ensure comprehensive logging of AI model interactions and performance

## Future Improvements
- Implement a more sophisticated caching system using Redis or a similar in-memory data store
- Develop a plugin system for easy integration of new AI models or services
