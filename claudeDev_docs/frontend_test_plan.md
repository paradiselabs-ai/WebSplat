## Test Execution

1. Run through all test cases manually
2. Document any issues or unexpected behavior
3. For any failed tests, provide detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. After fixing issues, re-run the affected test cases to verify the fix

## Reporting

Create a test report including:
- Summary of test results
- Detailed list of any issues found
- Recommendations for fixes or improvements
- Overall assessment of the frontend's readiness for the MVP demo

Remember to update this test plan as new features are added or existing ones are modified. Regular testing using this plan will help ensure the stability and functionality of the WebSplat interface.
