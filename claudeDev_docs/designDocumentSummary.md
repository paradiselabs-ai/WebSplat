# Design Document Summary

## Project Overview
WebSplat is a no-code framework for quickly building unique and sophisticated websites. It utilizes a hybrid AI agent system with adjustable levels of autonomy and creativity to create websites from scratch, focusing on passive income generation, SEO optimization, and ongoing maintenance.

## Key Features
1. Hybrid AI agent system with adjustable autonomy levels
2. Automatic model selection based on task complexity
3. Passive income generation strategies
4. Advanced SEO optimization
5. High visitor return rate mechanisms
6. Comprehensive business/market analytics integration
7. Real-time web search capabilities
8. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced knowledge

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React with Node.js, HTML, and CSS
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- AI Models: 
  - Primary: OpenAI o1-mini and o1-preview (via AI/ML API), Google Cloud Vertex AI
  - Secondary: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Perplexity, OpenRouter, Mistral
- Additional Tools: 
  - Tavily API for web search
  - GroundX for RAG
  - Hugging Face models for specialized tasks
- Database: To be determined based on specific requirements (considering options for advanced caching)

## Architecture Overview
The system uses a hybrid approach, combining the o1 model (via AI/ML API) and Vertex AI as primary models. The architecture includes:
- A Flask backend that coordinates AI agent activities
- A React frontend for user interaction and visualization
- An AI agent system that can automatically switch between models based on task complexity
- Integration with various AI services for specialized tasks
- A caching system to optimize performance and reduce API calls

## User Types
1. AI Agents: Autonomous website creation and management
2. Framework Users: Adjusting AI agent parameters, creating custom pages, monitoring AI performance
3. End Users: Interacting with the generated websites

## Core Functionality
- Hybrid AI agent collaboration and decision-making
- Automatic model selection for optimal task performance
- Website generation adhering to the "5 laws" of WebSplat
- User interface for framework users to monitor and control AI agents
- Comprehensive analytics and SEO integration
- Real-time web search and RAG capabilities for up-to-date information

## Future Considerations
- Implement more advanced caching system using a database for persistence
- Enhance project state management with version control and rollback capabilities
- Integrate code generation features for more sophisticated web development
- Implement collaborative features for AI agents to work on tasks simultaneously
- Explore potential uses for additional Hugging Face models
- Develop a more advanced dashboard for visualizing AI performance and website analytics

## Challenges and Considerations
- Balancing autonomy and control in the AI agent system
- Ensuring consistency and quality in AI-generated content and designs
- Managing API costs and optimizing resource usage across multiple AI services
- Maintaining data privacy and security, especially with the integration of various AI models
- Keeping the system flexible and extensible for future AI advancements
- Ensuring the generated websites comply with legal and ethical standards
- Optimizing the performance of the hybrid AI system to provide quick responses to users
