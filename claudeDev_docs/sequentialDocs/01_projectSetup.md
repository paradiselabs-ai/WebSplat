# 01 Project Setup

## Objectives
- Set up the initial project structure
- Configure the development environment
- Install necessary dependencies
- Create a scalable multiple end-user system for many different users to access a user-specific instance and environment of their own, allowing for vast amounts of users to use websplat's multi-agent workflow in a specific environment
- Figure out how to allow for potentially hundreds of users to use websplat in a specific environment and how to allow for potentially hundreds of users, if not more, to access all the features of websplat without having to enter their own API keys for each and every API connected to the websplat application
- Come up with logistical solutions for scalable numbers of end-users being able to access websplat in a clean new websplat instance and environment specific to the end-user
- Set up an authorization login to only provide access to end-users who have signed up for a websplat account and have paid to use certain services of websplat
- Create a system of tiers for end-users who can pay for higher tier levels in order to utilize more websplat features than other end-users of a lower tier level
- Create a way to handle so many different end-users and a database integration that can provide every end-user with a specific and new instance of websplat in their own environment for each end-user

## Steps

1. Create project directories
   - [x] Create src/, components/, pages/, and utils/ directories
   - [x] Create claudeDev_docs/ directory and its subdirectories
   - [x] Create tests/ directory

2. Initialize version control
   - [ ] Initialize git repository
   - [ ] Create .gitignore file

3. Set up frontend environment
   - [ ] Initialize Node.js project
   - [ ] Install React and necessary dependencies
   - [ ] Set up basic React application structure

4. Set up backend environment
   - [ ] Create virtual environment for Python
   - [ ] Install Flask and required packages
   - [ ] Set up basic Flask application structure

5. Configure AI models and tools
   - [ ] Set up OpenAI API integration
   - [ ] Configure Google Cloud Vertex AI
   - [ ] Set up Tavily API for web search
   - [ ] Integrate GroundX for RAG

6. Set up testing framework
   - [ ] Install testing libraries for both frontend and backend
   - [ ] Set up initial test files

7. Create initial configuration files
   - [ ] Create .env file for environment variables
   - [ ] Set up configuration files for different environments (development, production)

8. Document setup process
   - [ ] Update README.md with setup instructions
   - [ ] Document any environment-specific configurations

## Notes
- Ensure all team members have access to necessary API keys and credentials
- Consider using a package manager like Poetry for Python dependencies
- Use create-react-app for quick React project setup

## Next Steps
- Proceed to frontend structure development (02_frontendStructure.md)
- Begin designing the user interface for the AI agent dashboard
