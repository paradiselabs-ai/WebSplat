    - [ ] Plan for initial user onboarding and feedback collection

11. Post-launch strategy
    - [ ] Prepare for rapid iteration based on initial feedback
    - [ ] Set up analytics to track key performance indicators
    - [ ] Plan for feature prioritization post-launch
    - [ ] Prepare for scaling resources based on adoption

## Notes
- Ensure all team members are familiar with the deployment process
- Conduct thorough testing in a staging environment that mirrors production
- Prepare rollback procedures in case of critical issues during or after deployment

## Next Steps
