# 07 Deployment Preparation

## Objectives
- Figure out the best way to deploy the application and connect/configure the web domain "https://websp.lat" as the applications entry point for end-user usage of the application
- Create scalable multi-user environments and database to allow for a growing number of individual end-users with their own private instance of WebSplat
- Set up production environment configurations
- Create deployment scripts and procedures
- Implement monitoring and logging for production
- Prepare launch and post-launch strategies

## Steps

1. Production environment setup
   - [ ] Configure production environment variables
   - [ ] Set up production database
   - [ ] Configure production-ready web server (e.g., Gunicorn)
   - [ ] Set up SSL certificates for secure connections

2. Deployment script creation
   - [ ] Create automated deployment scripts
   - [ ] Implement database migration scripts
   - [ ] Set up static file handling for production

3. Performance optimization for production
   - [ ] Implement server-side rendering for initial load
   - [ ] Set up content delivery network (CDN) for static assets
   - [ ] Optimize database for production workloads

4. Security measures for production
   - [ ] Implement production-grade security measures
   - [ ] Set up firewall rules
   - [ ] Configure secure headers
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection

5. Monitoring and logging setup
   - [ ] Set up application performance monitoring (APM)
   - [ ] Implement centralized logging system
   - [ ] Create alerts for critical errors and performance issues
   - [ ] Set up uptime monitoring

6. Backup and disaster recovery
   - [ ] Implement automated backup procedures
   - [ ] Create disaster recovery plan
   - [ ] Test backup restoration processes

7. Scaling preparation
   - [ ] Set up load balancing for horizontal scaling
   - [ ] Implement caching strategies for high traffic
   - [ ] Prepare database sharding strategy if needed

8. Documentation finalization
   - [ ] Update all documentation for production use
   - [ ] Create runbooks for common operational tasks
   - [ ] Prepare user guides and FAQs for launch

9. Legal and compliance
   - [ ] Ensure GDPR and other regulatory compliance
   - [ ] Prepare terms of service and privacy policy
   - [ ] Set up cookie consent and data processing agreements

10. Launch preparation
    - [ ] Create a launch checklist
    - [ ] Prepare marketing materials and announcements
    - [ ] Set up customer support channels
    - [ ] Plan for initial user onboarding and feedback collection

11. Post-launch strategy
    - [ ] Prepare for rapid iteration based on initial feedback
    - [ ] Set up analytics to track key performance indicators
    - [ ] Plan for feature prioritization post-launch
    - [ ] Prepare for scaling resources based on adoption

## Notes
- Ensure all team members are familiar with the deployment process
- Conduct thorough testing in a staging environment that mirrors production
- Prepare rollback procedures in case of critical issues during or after deployment
- There needs to be a way to allow a large amount of different users to purchase and use the application inside of an environment exclusive to them. 
- The end-user's need to have an easy and clear way to control the autonomy and creativity levels of the entire multi-agent workflow, allowing for website creation according to the end-user's desires.
- If the end-user has very specific ideas and features they want or need implemented into their website created by the agents, the autonomy and creativity of the agents needs to be able to be adjusted to very low levels to allow the agents to follow the end-user's desires of the features of the website build by the websplat agents.
- If the end-user has a basic idea or goal for their website, but doesn't know exactly what or how to design the website they need to fit their goals, then the user needs to be able to raise the autonomy and creativity of the multi-agent workflow to allow the agents to creatively and autonomously help the user create the appropriate website for the end-user's idea, and along the way the end-user may refine their idea.
- If the end-user doesn't like a particular addition or feature of the website the agents are creating, the end-user must be able to stop the current workflow, rollback the progress to a certain point and prompt the change to the agents. 
- There must be clear and unique ways of prompting and prompt engineering allowing for the end-user to appropriately stop, rollback progress of, re-prompt, and conversationally explain their ideas or refine their desires for the website and the features of the website. The multi-agent workflow must be able to appropriately redirect and adapt to the end-user's prompt's and changes to the creation of the website when necessary.

## Next Steps
- Conduct final review of all systems and documentation
- Perform dress rehearsal of deployment process
- Prepare for hackathon demonstration and presentation
- Set up way for end-users to purchase and use the application at different tier levels, with different tiers determining the amount of features and capabilities each user is allowed to access.
