# 04 Backend Setup

## Objectives
- Set up Flask application structure
- Implement API endpoints for frontend communication
- Integrate AI models and external tools
- Set up database and ORM
- Scalable database for multiple end-users of websplat who upon logging in, using a secure authorization login, are able to access WebSplat in a new clean instance and environment for each end-user
- Authorization system to determine the access level for each authorized end-user

## Steps

1. Set up Flask application structure
   - [ ] Create main application file (app.py)
   - [ ] Set up configuration management
   - [ ] Implement blueprints for different modules

2. Develop API endpoints
   - [ ] Create routes for AI agent management
   - [ ] Implement endpoints for website generation
   - [ ] Develop API for user management and authentication
   - [ ] Create routes for analytics and SEO tools

3. Integrate AI models
   - [ ] Set up OpenAI API integration (o1-mini and o1-preview)
   - [ ] Implement Google Cloud Vertex AI integration
   - [ ] Set up Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Opus
   - [ ] Integrate Perplexity and OpenRouter

4. Implement external tool integrations
   - [ ] Set up Tavily API for web search functionality
   - [ ] Integrate GroundX for RAG capabilities

5. Set up database and ORM
   - [ ] Choose and set up database system
   - [ ] Implement ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy)
   - [ ] Create database models for users, websites, and AI agents

6. Implement authentication and authorization
   - [ ] Set up user authentication system
   - [ ] Implement role-based access control
   - [ ] Create middleware for protecting routes

7. Develop background task processing
   - [ ] Set up task queue system (e.g., Celery)
   - [ ] Implement background jobs for time-consuming tasks

8. Create logging and monitoring system
   - [ ] Set up application logging
   - [ ] Implement error tracking and reporting
   - [ ] Create system health monitoring endpoints

9. Implement caching mechanism
   - [ ] Set up caching system (e.g., Redis)
   - [ ] Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data

10. Develop testing suite for backend
    - [ ] Create unit tests for individual functions and classes
    - [ ] Implement integration tests for API endpoints
    - [ ] Set up test database and fixtures

## Notes
- Ensure proper error handling and validation for all API endpoints
- Focus on creating a scalable and maintainable backend structure
- Consider implementing API versioning for future compatibility

## Next Steps
- Move on to data integration (05_dataIntegration.md)
- Begin connecting frontend components to backend API endpoints
