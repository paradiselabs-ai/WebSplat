# Heres a list of specific agents i can think of

Head project manager - o1

project supervisors - vertex AI, claude 3.5 sonnet

Frontend designer - A vision model that is good at UX/UI design? which then can be turned into code by the frontend developers? maybe claude 3 opus prompting vertex or gemini? OR, different thought, would it be better if I prompt engineer a google studio AI model to talk to users as a client for a web developer company, and give the model code interpretation features, then have the model put the tsx code directly into the tsx renderer?

Lead Developers - o1, vertex, claude 3.5 sonnet

Frontend Developers - claude 3.5 sonnet, vertex ai

Backend Developers -  claude 3.5 sonnet, groq llama 3.1 tool use

Back-up developers (if needed for very large projects) - Codestral (from mistral), Wizardllama 2, starcoder 2

Research and development - Perplexity, vertex ai, any model using tavily

User Content Manager - Llama 3.1 or claude 3 opus with Ground x RAG, to add any content from files or add photos given by the user

Monetization agent - vertex ai, perplexity

SEO optimizer - vertex ai, perplexity

Deployment operations - vertex ai

Consultation Agent - vertex ai, claude 3.5 sonnet, o1 ((these wil need to work together WITH the frontend designer agent to provide quick tsx scripts for the site's UX/UI for the  home page, admin interface/dashboard, etc. if the user is building a website for a web application or service or tool to use, this will be especially needed, ((THERE WILL BE A LIVE TSX/React script renderer in the front end that the user can toggle to see, which will render the tsx or react scripts in near real time, both in desktop view and in tablet/smartphone view, so users can get a preview for how their site will look, the consulting agent(s) can work with the user to iterate on the designs, THESE DESIGNS WILL BE THE STARTING POINT FOR BUILDING THE WEBSITE. ))))

Consultation assistant, to keep track of, and add to groundx, information from the user -  claude 3 sonnet/opus

Security Agent - Claude 3.5 sonnet, vertex ai

Quality Assurance - Perplexity, o1, claude 3.5 sonnet (by reading the sites code)

Site Tester - Selenium and Claude 3.5 sonnet, vertex ai, human feedback.

So we need to set up a few different autogen chat groups, that either must be intertwined, or be able to communicate with each other. LLM tools like code interpretation and function calling will be given to every model that it is able to be given too, claude 3.5 sonnet, llama 3.1 with tool use, etc. These models can access vertex AI, give vertex/gemini prompts to follow,  and  use google cloud APIs and tools.
