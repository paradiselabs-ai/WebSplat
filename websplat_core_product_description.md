Websplat: A No-Code Web Development Framework Using A Team of AI Agents With A Conversational Workflow, Instead of Templates and Pre-existing Designs

## Project Name: WebSplat

### Project Type: Web Application

### Project Description

    WebSplat is a no-code framework for quickly building unique and sophisticated websites. It utilizes AI agents with adjustable levels of autonomy and creativity to create websites from scratch, focusing on passive income generation, SEO optimization, and ongoing maintenance.

AI Agent Autonomy and Collaboration:
WebSplat's core feature is its highly autonomous AI agent system. These agents are designed with adjustable levels of autonomy and creativity, similar to an LLM's temperature setting. At maximum autonomy, the agents can collaborate to conceive, design, and build an entire website without any human input beyond the "5 laws." This capability is VITAL to the project and will be used to debut the framework at the hackathon.
The "5 laws" that guide all agent actions, regardless of autonomy level, are:

The website must generate passive income
The design must be professional, unique, and sophisticated
The website must implement excellent SEO practices
The site must encourage high visitor return rates and feature unique user experiences
The website must incorporate business/market analytics and user/site visitor analytics

It is IMPERATIVE that the AI agents can communicate and collaborate effectively to create a fully functional website adhering to these laws, without any specific human prompts or instructions. This demonstration of complete autonomy is crucial for the hackathon submission and showcasing the power of the WebSplat framework.
User Types and Flows:

AI Agents: Autonomous website creation and management
Framework Users: Adjusting AI agent parameters, creating custom pages
End Users: Interacting with the generated websites
Design Preferences: Professional, unique, and sophisticated designs that surpass simple templates

Instructions for Claude Dev
You are tasked with setting up and developing the WebSplat project using the Claude Dev Design system. Follow these instructions carefully, asking for user feedback and clarification when necessary. Remember, you are working with an existing project structure and need to integrate new features and improvements.
Important: The project structure already exists. You will be working within this structure and adding new files and functionalities as needed.
